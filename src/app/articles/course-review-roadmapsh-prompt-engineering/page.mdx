If you've been wondering what all the buzz is about around prompt engineering (or even asking, "lol, is this actually a thing?"), LLM's, and AI in general, then roadmap.sh's Prompt Engineering Roadmap is a great place to start. Here's my concise review of the course.

## Summary

The course covers the basics: what a LLM is, what prompt engineering is, why it's needed, and strategies. It's a course you can go start-to-finish in a couple of hours, unless you're like me and want to read every link and watch every video. But it's essentially a lighter, visual wrapper around [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/), which is where you'll want to go if you know you want to improve your prompt engineering skills.

## Relevance to the Industry: 9/10

- Prompt engineering jobs aren't plentiful, but knowing how to write effective prompts can be a huge advantage in your career
- It's a skill that's becoming increasingly important as AI becomes more prevalent in our lives
- It's a future-proof skill since people will always need to guide AI

## Scope: 7/10

- Covers the majority of topics (that I'm aware of) related to prompt engineering
- Does not cover image generation (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- Does not cover model differences (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 vs LLaMA)
- Does not cover LangChain or other LLM frameworks

## Technical Depth: 7/10

- It's a great start for beginners, but it's not a deep dive
- Missing examples for the majority of topics
- Suggested reading for each topic almost always links to [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/) and no other resources
- Does cover the pitfalls of prompt engineering and strategies to avoid them

## Hands-on Coding: 2/10

- There are no hands-on coding exercises
- Does not cover how to run the examples it does have
- Requires you to copy-paste code snippets into ChatGPT

## Quality of Code Examples: 6/10

- The examples are covered well, but again, it's essentially just [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/)'s content
- But the code snippets do not wrap, so they're almost unreadable unless you copy them into an editor
- For some reason, it doesn't cover all of [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/)'s content, so you'll have to go there to see the rest

## Community Support: 10/10

- roadmap.sh's platform asks users to submit links to resources, so it's constantly evolving
- roadmap.sh is open-source, so anyone can contribute
- roadmap.sh has a Discord server with 700+ members

## Updates: 3/10

- Need to go to GitHub to see when the last update was made
- The roadmap was created May 19th, 2023, and since then has only had 9 updates in over 3 months
- Given that it's an evolving field, I would expect updates much more frequently

## Final Verdict: 6/10

- Take it if you're looking for an intro into prompt engineering
- If you want a proper course on prompt engineering, go to [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/)

That's it, folks. Hope this helps you decide whether this course is your jam or not. Cheers!
